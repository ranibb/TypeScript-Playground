/**
 * By class inheritance or extension which means the same, drive class Observation that inherits from the 
 * Point class but in addition to the coordinates also includes a time stamp and a height information. 
 * Think of the case of a Trekking app that can record mountain treks or hikes. For that we need to know not 
 * only the current locations but also the times and heights. Also overwrite the constructor to include all 4 
 * parameters. The two coordinates as before, the timestamp and the current height. It is important here not 
 * to add access modifiers at the coordinates since we inherit the location properties and don't want to 
 * redeclare instance properties for the coordinates. Whereas we add the access modifiers private at the 
 * other two parameters indicating we want to declare them also as instance properties. To initialize the 
 * extended class instance, first initialize the base class which is the point class. To access a base class 
 * we have the special keyword "super". Therefore, call the constructor of the base class with super followed 
 * by the parameters in brackets, in our case, the coordinates. After initializing the super class we would 
 * proceed to initialize the remaining properties timestamp and height. However, we don't need to do that since 
 * it is done automatically by TypeScript when using the shortcut notation with access modifiers added to the 
 * constructor parameters. The procedure of initialization of a sub class is always the same. In a first step, 
 * we initialize the super class, and in a second step we initialize the properties added in the sub class.
