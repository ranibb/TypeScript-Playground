    maps employees to true that are managers and others to false. This is the idea behind the type that 
    is defined as a returned value.*/

    You might ask why we donâ€™t return the filtered array directly but separated out into steps? 2 reasons: 
    First: It is good to repeat some stuff that you learned already; how to deal with function as a parameter 
    and returned value. Second: We could extend the solution more easily. For example, we could add other 
    filters and just to define the filtering rule that don't need to touch the code for the filter application.*/
