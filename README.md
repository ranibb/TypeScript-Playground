# TypeScript Playground

* Run `npm start` for TypeScript execution and REPL (read–eval–print loop).

## Exercises

### Provide a way to easily switch on and off logging.

At the moment, logging is always on, so the console is always spoiled by all these logging messages, even we don't need them. Obviously, it would be desirable to have the option to switch on and off logging.

### Rewrite the totalDistance method in the Trail Class with the Array methods map and reduce

We computed the total distance of a trail by adding up the individual distances between the points using a for..loop. Now we want to replace the loop by the two array methods maps and reduce. Remember that `map` is used to transform an array into another array and `reduce` maps an array on a single value.
 
### Add a TrailRecording Class which can record Trails automatically based on a function that provides the current location

### Refactor the TrailRecording Class into a NameSpace
