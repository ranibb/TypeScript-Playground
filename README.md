# Modules and Namespaces

Modules and Namespaces are concepts that help us to organize our TypeScript code. With Modules we distribute the code over different files and with Namespaces we group code within a file.

## Namespaces: Group variables or functions within a file
In the Second part we cover Namespaces. Namespaces are similar than modules but they are defined within a file. We could for example group a couple of related functions under common namespace and put them on their own scope. The functions are then accessed from outside the namespace with the given name followed by a dot.
