# TypeScript Playground

* Run `npm start` for TypeScript execution and REPL (read–eval–print loop).

# Advanced Type Construction
This lesson contains some more advanced topics related to TypeScript's type system.

## Advanced Array Manipulation

every/some function: used to evaluate arrays of Boolean.

map function: constructs a new array by transforming an existing array.

reduce function: computes a single value from an array.

## Sets and Maps as additional collection Types

A set models an ordered data and a map describes a key value mapping. In most other programming languages, maps are known as dictionaries.

## Union Types

We use union types for variables that could contain data of different types.

## Type Mapping

Derived by manipulating other types.
